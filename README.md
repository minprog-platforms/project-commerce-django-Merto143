# Application Name

TODO: This application will display allow users to create, bid and comment on different auctions. To do these actions, the user must be logged in. If the user is not logged in he/she can still view all the current pages. The user also is able to add an item to his/her watchlist. There is a seperate watchlist page where the user can view all the items on his/her watchlist. On the main page the user can also sort by category.


## Getting Started

TODO: We must make a database where we store all the user that enter the website. We must also store all the items and details of the item (name, price, owner description etc.). We must also store all the comments and bids in seperate classes. We must check if bids placed are high enough, if not the user must get an error message.
